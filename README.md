# Galvanic-Biosensor
This is a repository detailing my work on a galvanic biosensor. It measures the stress levels of a human based on the level of electrical resistance of the person's fingers.

When a person is stressed, their sweat glands open up, increasing the resistivity of the skin. This project aims to use this property in order to measure the stress levels of 
the subject human. For this project, I am using a custom PCB (KiCad progress included), an Arduino Uno, pinned connecting wires, and two coins as the base sensors for two fingers. Schematics, PCB designs, and code are included in this repository in their own respective folders.
